# AI Matching Service Explanation

This document explains the workings of the AI Matching Service within the `ai-recruitment-backend` project. It is designed to help frontend developers understand how to integrate with this service.

## 1. Purpose

The AI Matching Service is responsible for calculating the compatibility (match score) between candidates and jobs. It uses a hybrid AI approach, combining multiple models to provide comprehensive and accurate matching results. The service also supports skill extraction and similarity calculations between arbitrary texts.

## 2. Core Components

The primary logic for the matching service resides in the following files:

*   <mcfile name="matching_service.py" path="c:\Users\MSI\ai-recruitment-backend\app\services\matching_service.py"></mcfile>: Contains the main business logic for matching candidates to jobs and vice-versa, and orchestrates the use of AI models.
*   <mcfile name="hybrid_ai_service.py" path="c:\Users\MSI\ai-recruitment-backend\app\services\hybrid_ai_service.py"></mcfile>: (Placeholder) This file is intended to house the actual AI model implementations and their logic for calculating scores and extracting skills.
*   <mcfile name="ai_matching_routes.py" path="c:\Users\MSI\ai-recruitment-backend\app\routes\ai_matching_routes.py"></mcfile>: Defines the API endpoints through which the matching service can be accessed.

## 3. How the Matching Works

The matching process involves several steps:

1.  **Data Retrieval**: The service fetches relevant data for candidates (CVs, skills, experience, education) and jobs (title, description, requirements, location) from the database.
2.  **Text Preparation**: The retrieved structured and unstructured data for both candidates and jobs is combined and processed into a textual format suitable for AI model input.
3.  **Hybrid AI Scoring**: The prepared texts are fed into the `HybridAIService`. This service is designed to utilize multiple AI models (e.g., SBERT for semantic similarity, Skill2Vec for skill-based similarity) to generate different scores.
4.  **Score Aggregation**: The individual scores from different AI models are combined to produce a final `hybrid_score`. The service also provides the individual model scores (e.g., `sbert_similarity`, `skill2vec_similarity`).
5.  **Skill Matching**: The service identifies and returns common skills between the candidate's resume and the job's requirements.
6.  **Result Structuring**: The calculated scores and other relevant job/candidate details are structured into a comprehensive response, sorted by the hybrid match score.

**Note on Database Persistence**: Currently, the calculated match scores (including individual model scores and the hybrid score) are **returned as part of the API response** but are **now automatically saved to a dedicated database table (`candidate_job_matches`)** by the service itself.

## 4. Automatic Matching Triggers

*   **CV Upload**: When a candidate's CV is fully uploaded and its information extracted via the `POST /api/cv/upload` endpoint, the system automatically triggers a candidate-to-job matching process. The results are saved to the `candidate_job_matches` table.
*   **Job Addition**: When a new job offer is added via the `POST /api/jobs` endpoint, the system automatically triggers a job-to-candidate matching process. The results are saved to the `candidate_job_matches` table.

## 5. AI Models Involved (Conceptual)

The `hybrid_ai_service.py` is designed to integrate various AI models. Conceptually, it might include:

*   **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)**: For calculating semantic similarity between the overall candidate text and job description. This model understands the meaning and context of sentences.
*   **Skill2Vec**: For embedding skills into vector space and calculating similarity based on skill sets. This helps in identifying how well a candidate's skills align with job requirements.
*   **SkillNER (Skill Named Entity Recognition)**: For extracting skills from unstructured text (e.g., CVs, job descriptions).

## 6. API Endpoints

The AI Matching Service exposes the following REST API endpoints, defined in <mcfile name="ai_matching_routes.py" path="c:\Users\MSI\ai-recruitment-backend\app\routes\ai_matching_routes.py"></mcfile>:

*   **Response**: Success message with the new job's ID or an error.

## 7. Integration Notes for Frontend

*   **Base URL**: All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/ai-matching`.
*   **Authentication**: Most endpoints require a JWT token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`). Ensure your frontend handles token acquisition and attachment.
*   **Error Handling**: The API returns standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized, 500 for internal server error) and JSON error messages.
*   **Data Formats**: Expect JSON for both request bodies (where applicable) and responses.
*   **Testing**: You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to test these endpoints directly against the running backend.
*   **Triggering Matching**: Note that matching is now automatically triggered upon CV upload and job creation, so no separate API calls are needed from the frontend for this purpose.
